<div class="summary">
<p>This is the web site for an in-progress textbook about practical engineering with <a href="http://coq.inria.fr/">the Coq proof assistant</a>.  The focus is on building programs with proofs of correctness, using dependent types and scripted proof automation.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>Updated on November 16, 2009 with a version retargeted to Coq 8.2pl1.  Last incremental update on December 30, 2009.</p>

<p>The current version is effectively a beta release.  It is intended to be consistent, self-contained, and useful, both for individual study and for introductory theorem-proving classes aimed at students with ML or Haskell experience and with basic familiarity with programming language theory.</p>

<p>The main omissions have to do with some supporting resources that I didn't get around to implementing when I used this book for a course.  Some suggested exercises are present, but only at points where I was looking to assign an exercise in the course.  Some chapters are lacking the annotations used to build reduced versions of their source code, where some definitions and proofs have been elided; the course instructor can step through such a file, guiding class participants in filling in the omitted code.</p>
